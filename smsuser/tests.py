Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the 'feedback' function is to render the 'feedback.html' template for authenticated users only. It ensures that the user is logged in before accessing the feedback page.

Inputs:
The function takes in a 'request' object as input, which contains information about the current request made by the user.

Flow:
1. The function first checks if the user is authenticated by using the 'login_required' decorator.
2. If the user is authenticated, the function renders the 'feedback.html' template using the 'render' function and returns it as the response.

Outputs:
The main output of the function is the rendered 'feedback.html' template, which is only accessible to authenticated users.

Additional aspects:
- The 'login_required' decorator redirects the user to the login page if they are not authenticated.
- The 'feedback.html' template may contain a form for users to submit feedback or suggestions.
